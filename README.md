---

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation
Simply copy the folder "```Packages/FarrokGames.Inventory```" into your own projects packages folder and you're good to go. Optionally, you can add the folder "```Assets/Example```" to get started right away.

---

## <a id="example"></a>Example
A fully functional example is included with this reposetory and can be found in the folder "```Assets/Example```". 

- ```Inventory Overlay.scene``` - the Unity Scene that contains an example using the Canvas render mode of Screen Space Overlay.
- ```Inventory Camera.scene``` - the Unity Scene that contains an example using the Canvas render mode of Screen Space Camera.
- ```Inventory World Space.scene``` - the Unity Scene that contains an example using the Canvas render mode of World Space.
- ```Inventory.png``` - includes all artwork used in the example.
- ```ItemDefinition.cs``` - a ```ScriptableObject``` implemetation of ```IInventoryItem```.
- ```SizeInventoryExample.cs``` - a ```MonoBehaviour``` that creates and connects an Inventory with a Renderer, and fills it with items.
- ```Items-folder``` - Contains the ```ItemDefinitions``` used in the example.

## <a id="documentation"></a>Documentation
Below you can find documentation of various parts of the system. You are encouraged to look through the code, where more in-depth code docs can be found.

---

### <a id="gettingstarted"></a>Getting Started
Creating a new inventory is simple. Remember that the inventory system rests within its own namespace, so don't forget to add ```using FarrokhGames.Inventory```.
```csharp
var inventory = new InventoryManager(8, 4); // Creates an inventory with a width of 8 and height of 4
```

---

### <a id='theinventory'></a>The Inventory
Below is a list of actions methods and getters within ```InventoryManager.cs```.
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Invoked when an item is added to the inventory
/// </summary>
Action<IInventoryItem> onItemAdded { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Invoked when an item was not able to be added to the inventory
/// </summary>
Action<IInventoryItem> onItemAddedFailed { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Invoked when an item is removed to the inventory
/// </summary>
Action<IInventoryItem> onItemRemoved { get; set; }

/// <summary>

```

### <a id="items"></a>Items
Items inside the inventory are represented by the IInventoryItem interface. In the included example, this interface is attached to a ```ScritableObject``` making it possible to create, store and change item details in the asset folder.
```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using FarrokhGames.Inventory;

/// <summary>
/// ScriptableObject representing an Inventory Item
/// </summary>
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "Item", menuName = "Inventory/Item", order = 1)]
public class ItemDefinition : ScriptableObject, IInventoryItem
{
    [SerializeField] private Sprite _sprite;
    [SerializeField] private InventoryShape _shape;
    [SerializeField] private bool _canDrop;

    public string Name => return this.name;
    public Sprite Sprite =>  return _sprite;
    public InventoryShape Shape => _shape;
    public bool canDrop => _canDrop;

    /// <summary>
    /// Creates a copy if this scriptable object
    /// </summary>
    public IInventoryItem CreateInstance()
    {
        return ScriptableObject.Instantiate(this);
    }
}
```
The shape of an item is defined by the serializable ```ItemShape.cs``` class which has a useful property drawer.

### <a id="rendering"></a>Rendering the Inventory
The inventory system comes with a renderer in a MonoBehaviour called ```InventoryRenderer.cs```.

<img src="Documentation/renderer.png?raw=true" alt="Zenject" width="338px" height="486px"/>

Simply add this to a ```GameObject``` within your ```Canvas```, and connect it to an inventory using the following code.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Set what inventory to use when rendering
/// </summary>
/// <param name="inventory">Inventory to use</param>
public void SetInventory(InventoryManager inventory);
```

*Please see the image at the top of this document as an example of how the rendering looks*

---

### <a id="interacting"></a>Interacting with the Inventory
To enable interactions (drag and drop), add ```InventoryController.cs``` to the same ```GameObject``` as your renderer.

---

### <a id="otherfiles"></a>Other files included
Besides the actual inventory, there are sipport-classes included in the reposetory.

- ```Pool.cs``` - A generic pool of objects that can be retrieved and recycled without invoking additional allocations. Used by the ```Renderer``` to pool sprites.

**You are free to use these** support-classes under the same license, and their ```Unit Tests``` are included.
